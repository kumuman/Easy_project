**some projects for beginner.**

**The calculator.cpp is the core of the calculator program.**

**The main.cpp is used to run the program.**

**This project is developed using VS2019 and Qt. You may need to configure the corresponding environment to run the project.**

**This project currently has some limitations, such as the lack of parentheses functionality.
I am still learning programming, and this is my first release. My capabilities are limited, and I hope for your understanding.**
